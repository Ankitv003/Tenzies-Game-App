# Tenzies Game App

Welcome to the Tenzies Game App! This is a fun and interactive game where you roll dice and try to get all ten dice to show the same value. The game features a timer to track how quickly you can complete the challenge, and it stores your best time in local storage.

## Features

- **Dice Rolling**: Roll ten dice at once and hold specific dice to keep their values while rerolling the rest.
- **Timer**: A timer starts when the game begins and stops when you achieve Tenzies (all dice show the same value).
- **Best Time Storage**: The app stores your best time in local storage, so you can challenge yourself to beat it each time you play.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and can be played on any device.

## How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice**: Click the "Roll" button to roll all ten dice.
2. **Hold Dice**: Click on any dice to hold its value, so it won't be rerolled.
3. **Roll Again**: Continue rolling until all ten dice show the same value.
4. **Win the Game**: When all dice show the same value, you've won the game! Your time will be displayed, and if it's your best time, it will be saved.

## Technologies Used
